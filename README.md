Objective
Build an AI model that predicts whether an auto insurance claim is fraudulent or not using the provided dataset.

steps
1. Understand the Problem & Data:
Read the data dictionary carefully ‚Äî understand each column and its meaning.

Identify:

Target variable: likely something like is_fraud or similar.

Input features: driver details, claim amount, accident description, etc.

Use df.info(), df.describe(), and df.isnull().sum() to understand the dataset structure.


2. Explore & Visualize
Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Class balance of target variable.

Distribution of numerical and categorical features.

Correlation matrix to identify strong predictors.

Visual tools:

seaborn.heatmap(), countplot(), pairplot()


3. Preprocess the Data
Handle missing values: Fill or drop depending on % missing.

Encode categorical features: Use LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder.

Feature scaling for numerical columns: StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

Feature engineering (if needed): Create new features like:

Claim amount per year of driving

Time since policy start

Accident severity categories

4. Model Building
Try multiple models and compare:

Model	Why Try It
Logistic Regression	Good baseline
Random Forest	Handles imbalance, robust
XGBoost	Powerful for structured data
CatBoost / LightGBM	Especially good with categorical data

Use StratifiedKFold or train_test_split with stratification.

5. Model Evaluation
Use appropriate metrics:

Primary metric: Likely AUC, F1-score, or Accuracy (check submission file structure).

Handle imbalanced classes with:

class_weight='balanced'

SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling)

Plot:

Confusion matrix

ROC-AUC curve

Precision-Recall curve

6. Feature Importance & Explainability
Use .feature_importances_ or SHAP values to explain predictions.

Tools: SHAP, LIME.

7. Prepare Final Submission
Format the predicted output exactly like the ‚Äúresults submission file‚Äù.

Ensure the IDs and order match what‚Äôs expected.

Use .to_csv(index=False) to save final predictions.








## üìÅ Project Structure Overview

 project contains:
‚Ä¢ **Dataset folder** with 5 files:
  ‚Ä¢ 2 training datasets (Auto Insurance Fraud Claims (1).csv & 02.csv)
  ‚Ä¢ 1 test dataset (Auto Insurance Fraud Claims (2).csv) 
  ‚Ä¢ 1 results template (Auto Insurance Fraud Claims Results.csv)
  ‚Ä¢ 1 data dictionary file
‚Ä¢ **Python analysis script** (fraud_detection_analysis.py) - 19KB of code
‚Ä¢ **EDA visualization** (fraud_detection_eda.png) - comprehensive analysis charts
‚Ä¢ **Virtual environment** (fraud_detection_env/) for dependencies
‚Ä¢ **README.md** with your 7-step methodology

## üîç What we Accomplished

### 1. Data Loading & Structure
Your Python script shows you've:
‚Ä¢ Combined two training datasets into one
‚Ä¢ Loaded test data for final predictions
‚Ä¢ Set up a proper class-based pipeline (FraudDetectionPipeline)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
From your visualization, I can see you've analyzed:

Key Findings:
‚Ä¢ **Class Distribution**: ~74.7% Non-Fraud vs ~25.3% Fraud (roughly 3:1 ratio)
‚Ä¢ **Age Patterns**: Similar age distributions between fraud/non-fraud cases
‚Ä¢ **Policy Premiums**: Fraud cases show slightly different premium patterns
‚Ä¢ **Claim Amounts**: Both fraud and non-fraud show similar total claim distributions
‚Ä¢ **Vehicle Costs**: No major differences between fraud/non-fraud vehicle costs
‚Ä¢ **Feature Correlations**: Heat map shows relationships between numerical features

### 3. Code Implementation Progress
Your script includes:
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive data loading functions
‚Ä¢ EDA methods with statistical analysis
‚Ä¢ Missing value analysis
‚Ä¢ Data type examination
‚Ä¢ Visualization setup with seaborn/matplotlib
