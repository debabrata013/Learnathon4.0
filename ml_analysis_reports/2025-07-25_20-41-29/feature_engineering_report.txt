FEATURE ENGINEERING & SELECTION ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This report details the feature selection and engineering process for fraud detection.
From the original dataset, 15 key features were selected and
5 new features were engineered to enhance model performance.

1. SELECTED FEATURES ANALYSIS
------------------------------
Selection Methodology:
• F-statistic for measuring linear relationships with target
• Statistical significance testing for feature relevance
• Top 15 features selected based on F-scores

Selected Features and Their Business Relevance:
 1. Claim_ID                  (F-Score: nan)
    Business relevance: Claim amounts indicate potential fraud patterns

 2. Accident_Severity         (F-Score: 11744.9330)

 3. Garage_Location           (F-Score: 1360.4753)

 4. Hobbies                   (F-Score: 1215.7311)

 5. Collision_Type            (F-Score: 1206.3501)

 6. authorities_contacted     (F-Score: 463.0895)

 7. Commute_Discount          (F-Score: 405.4499)

 8. Witnesses                 (F-Score: 287.2292)

 9. Umbrella_Limit            (F-Score: 215.3523)

10. Policy_State              (F-Score: 191.2990)
    Business relevance: Policy details influence claim patterns

11. Num_of_Vehicles_Involved  (F-Score: 141.0470)
    Business relevance: Vehicle characteristics affect fraud likelihood

12. Acccident_State           (F-Score: 140.0714)

13. Accident_Type             (F-Score: 139.2636)

14. Property_Damage           (F-Score: 139.0514)

15. Accident_Location         (F-Score: 135.9201)

2. ENGINEERED FEATURES
----------------------
Created 5 new features:

1. Claim_Premium_Ratio
   Purpose: Ratio of claim amount to premium - identifies inflated claims
   Statistics: Mean=11.3825, Std=8.9059
               Min=0.4063, Max=110.9038

2. Age_Risk_Score
   Purpose: Risk score based on age demographics - captures age-related patterns
   Statistics: Mean=0.2033, Std=0.4619
               Min=0.0000, Max=2.0000

3. Vehicle_Claim_Ratio
   Purpose: Ratio of claim to vehicle value - detects value fraud
   Statistics: Mean=1.2816, Std=1.2228
               Min=0.0201, Max=15.2855

4. Claim_Complexity_Score
   Purpose: Number of claim components - measures claim complexity
   Statistics: Mean=3.0000, Std=0.0000
               Min=3.0000, Max=3.0000

5. Feature_Interaction
   Purpose: Mathematical interaction between top features
   Statistics: Mean=1.1715, Std=0.9371
               Min=0.0000, Max=3.0000

3. FEATURE ENGINEERING BEST PRACTICES APPLIED
----------------------------------------------
• Domain Knowledge Integration: Features designed based on insurance fraud patterns
• Ratio Features: Created meaningful ratios to capture relative relationships
• Categorical Risk Scoring: Converted continuous variables to risk categories
• Interaction Features: Captured relationships between multiple variables
• Normalization: Applied StandardScaler to ensure feature scale consistency
• Business Interpretability: Ensured all features have clear business meaning

4. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MODEL DEVELOPMENT
----------------------------------------
• Use both selected original features and engineered features
• Apply tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) for feature interactions
• Monitor feature importance to validate engineering decisions
• Use stratified cross-validation to maintain fraud class distribution
• Consider class balancing techniques due to imbalanced dataset
• Validate engineered features prevent overfitting
