UPDATED FEATURE ENGINEERING & SELECTION ANALYSIS REPORT
=======================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
Updated feature engineering incorporating your specific requirements.
Selected 15 features including all requested ones.
Created 5 new features leveraging requested features.

Successfully integrated requested features:
✓ Annual_Mileage - Included and prioritized
✓ DiffIN_Mileage - Included and prioritized
✓ Auto_Make - Included and prioritized
✓ Vehicle_Cost - Included and prioritized

Removed features as requested:
✓ Hobbies - Successfully removed from selection

2. ENHANCED ENGINEERED FEATURES
-------------------------------
1. Claim_Premium_Ratio
   Purpose: Ratio of claim to premium - detects inflated claims
   Statistics: Mean=11.3825, Std=8.9059

2. Age_Risk_Score
   Purpose: Age-based risk scoring for demographic patterns
   Statistics: Mean=0.2033, Std=0.4619

3. Vehicle_Claim_Ratio
   Purpose: Uses Vehicle_Cost to detect value-based fraud
   Statistics: Mean=1.2816, Std=1.2228

4. Mileage_Discrepancy_Score
   Purpose: Uses DiffIN_Mileage and Annual_Mileage to detect odometer fraud
   Statistics: Mean=0.4927, Std=0.2622

5. Vehicle_Age_Risk
   Purpose: Vehicle age-based risk assessment for older vehicles
   Statistics: Mean=0.0000, Std=0.0000

3. FEATURE SELECTION RATIONALE
------------------------------
Selection methodology updated to prioritize your requirements:
• Must-include features: Annual_Mileage, DiffIN_Mileage, Auto_Make, Vehicle_Cost
• Excluded features: Hobbies (as requested)
• Remaining slots filled with highest F-statistic features
• All features validated for business relevance

4. UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------
• Prioritize tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) for Auto_Make categorical handling
• Use mileage-based features for odometer fraud detection patterns
• Leverage Vehicle_Cost for high-value fraud identification
• Apply feature interactions between mileage and vehicle characteristics
• Monitor engineered features for overfitting with new feature set
